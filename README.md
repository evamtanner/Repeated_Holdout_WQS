# Code to Implement Repeated Holdout Validation for Weighted Quantile Sum Regression
* Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression is a method used to examine chemical mixtures in relation to a health outcome of interest. 
* Data is typically randomly partitioned into a single training set for estimating weights, and a single test set for assessing the association between between the weighted index and the outcome. However, this may produce unstable estimates in finite samples.
* Repeated holdout validation solves this problem by partitioning data m times (>=100) to simulate a distribution of validated results.
